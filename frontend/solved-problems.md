# Solved Problems

This document tracks test issues that have been fixed and the solutions implemented.

## Fixed Issues

1. **ProtectedRouteSimple.test.jsx**
   - **Issue**: TypeError: expect(...).toBeInTheDocument is not a function
   - **Solution**: Fixed Jest DOM testing library setup by properly importing and extending Jest's expect in setupTests.js using ES6 import syntax

2. **SimpleTest.test.js**
   - **Issue**: TypeError: expect(...).toBeInTheDocument is not a function
   - **Solution**: Added proper jest-dom import and implemented correct DOM assertions

3. **Component Tests**
   - **Issue**: React warnings about unknown props on DOM elements
   - **Solution**: Enhanced Chakra UI mock components to properly handle special props without passing them directly to DOM elements
   
4. **Redux Thunk Actions**
   - **Issue**: Error "Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions"
   - **Solution**: Replaced basic action creator mocks with proper thunk-style implementations that return functions

5. **Module Import Issues**
   - **Issue**: Error "Jest encountered an unexpected token" with ES modules in axios
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created a proper axios mock to handle ES module syntax
     - Updated transformIgnorePatterns in Jest config to transform more module types
     - Added proper ES module exports with __esModule: true flag

6. **ES Module Integration**
   - **Issue**: Despite adding axios mock, still having issues with ES module imports
   - **Solution**:
     - Created fully compatible ES module mocks with proper export structure
     - Enhanced the axios and apiClient mocks with complete interface implementation
     - Ensured consistent return value patterns for mocked functions

7. **Redux State Access**
   - **Issue**: Error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'state')"
   - **Solution**:
     - Implemented a more robust mockStore creator with proper deep state merging
     - Added consistent getState method to mock store for thunk testing
     - Fixed circular dependency issues by properly mocking the store module

8. **Chakra UI Rendering**
   - **Issue**: Component tests having issues with useColorModeValue and Chakra props
   - **Solution**:
     - Added explicit mock for useColorModeValue to return consistent values
     - Implemented ChakraProvider wrapper in component tests
     - Enhanced property filtering for Chakra UI components

## Test Setup Improvements

1. **setupTests.js**
   - Updated to use ES6 imports for Jest DOM: `import '@testing-library/jest-dom'`
   - Removed explicit extension of matchers which was causing issues
   - Fixed import ordering to ensure proper load sequence

2. **setupJestMocks.js**
   - Created centralized mock setup to handle consistent mocking across tests
   - Added proper ES module support with __esModule flag
   - Implemented thunk-compatible action creator mocks
   - Set up consistent mock state structure for Redux store testing

3. **Jest Configuration**
   - Updated transformIgnorePatterns to handle more file types (js, jsx, ts, tsx)
   - Made sure relevant node_modules are being transformed by Babel
   - Added proper module mocking for ES module compatibility

## Chakra UI Mocking Improvements

1. **Fixed Chakra UI Props in Tests**
   - Added proper handling for Chakra-specific props:
     - borderRadius, borderWidth, borderColor
     - colorScheme
     - isOpen and other UI state props
     - Grid/SimpleGrid columns and spacing
   - Converted non-standard props to style objects or data attributes
   - Created more robust mock components that handle a wider range of Chakra UI props
   - Implemented better type filtering to avoid DOM prop warnings

2. **Component Mocking Strategy**
   - Implemented comprehensive property filtering for Chakra UI components
   - Created a list of known Chakra UI props to filter out or handle specially
   - Implemented data attributes for boolean props and special state props
   - Preserved style inheritance while adding Chakra-specific styling
   - Created special mock implementations for Modal, AlertDialog, and Drawer components to correctly handle isOpen prop

## Async Testing Patterns

1. **Improved Async Test Handling**
   - Used waitFor consistently to handle async component rendering
   - Implemented proper async/await patterns with expect
   - Used queryBy instead of getBy for optional elements
   - Added additional waiting for components to be fully rendered

2. **Redux Thunk Action Creator Mocking**
   - Enhanced mock implementation to return thunk functions instead of plain objects
   - Correctly simulated async action patterns with proper dispatch calls
   - Implemented proper promise resolution for async action testing
   - Used the thunk middleware in mock store setup to properly handle async actions

## API Mocking

1. **Axios Mock Improvements**
   - Created complete axios mock implementation with all required methods
   - Added proper promise return values with consistent data structure
   - Implemented interceptors and defaults matching real axios implementation
   - Ensured ES module compatibility with proper exports

2. **API Client Enhancements**
   - Created consistent response format for all API methods
   - Added proper success/error pattern matching backend API
   - Implemented predictable mocking pattern for API testing
   - Fixed circular dependencies by using separate mock files

## Common Solutions

1. **Jest DOM Setup**
   - Simplified the setup by relying on the auto-extension mechanism of jest-dom
   - Used direct import without explicit matcher extension to avoid null/undefined errors
   - Configured test utilities to use the correct import patterns

2. **Redux Testing**
   - Configure test store with appropriate middleware using thunk.withExtraArgument()
   - Created deep merge utility for proper state nesting
   - Implemented proper thunk action creators for async tests
   - Fixed store state initialization for component testing

3. **Component Testing**
   - Wrap components in necessary providers (ChakraProvider, Provider)
   - Implemented waitFor for all component render testing
   - Used proper async testing patterns with findBy and queryBy
   - Created consistent rendering utilities for test components

4. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Created dedicated mock files to avoid circular dependencies
   - Implemented proper import order for mock dependencies
   - Used require() for circular dependency resolution in test files
   - Separated store setup from component rendering in tests
