2. **Workout Page**
   - Recommends workouts based on user goals and fitness level
   - Provides functionality for logging completed workouts
   - Allows scheduling workouts with Google Calendar integration
   - Displays workout history and progress

3. **Nutrition Page**
   - Enables food logging with search functionality
   - Calculates nutritional benefits of logged food
   - Displays macronutrient breakdown and summaries
   - Handles missing food items with custom entry options

4. **Diet Page**
